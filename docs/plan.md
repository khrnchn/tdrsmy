Goal
Launch a functional Tadarus Tap web app on tadarus.my by late March, with core features for group tadarus tracking and a “Tadarus Wrapped” summary by Ramadan’s end. Submit to #GodamSahur by April 1 with a demo-ready MVP.

Phases
Setup & Foundation (March 9–12)
Initialize Next.js (App Router), Shadcn/UI, Drizzle ORM, and database (PlanetScale or Vercel Postgres).
Deploy a skeleton app to Vercel (tied to tadarus.my).
Basic layout: homepage, auth, and a “join circle” teaser.

Core Features (March 13–20)
User auth (Clerk or NextAuth for speed).
Circle creation/joining + tadarus logging.
Real-time progress bar per circle.
Leaderboard (basic ranking by pages read).

Polish & Wrapped (March 21–28)
Notifications (email or PWA push).
“Tadarus Wrapped” page: circle stats, personal highlights, shareable card.
UI tweaks with Shadcn for Ramadan vibes (dark mode, clean typography).
Test with 2–3 dummy circles.

Final Push (March 29–April 1)
Bug fixes, performance optimization.
Record demo video for #GodamSahur submission.
Launch live on tadarus.my.

Key Deliverables
MVP: Users can sign up, join/create circles, log tadarus, see group progress, and check a leaderboard.
Wrapped: End-of-Ramadan summary with stats (e.g., “Your geng read 1,200 pages!”) and a shareable graphic.
Submission: Deployed app + 2-min demo video showing a circle in action.
